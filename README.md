EthicalAlt is a mobile-first web app that turns your camera into a conscience. Point it at anything on a shelf, in a store window, or in your home — tap the brand — and receive a structured investigation of that company's environmental record, labor practices, political spending, and documented controversies, plus verified independent alternatives sourced from Etsy, local sellers, and nearby businesses.

The investigation is not opinion. It is a structured record with sourced evidence, graded by confidence, with clear separation in the UI between **database** profiles and **live** research so you know what to verify.

## The core loop

```
Photograph → Tap object → Identify brand → Investigate → Act
```

1. **Photograph** — open the camera, point at any product or scene
2. **Tap** — touch any item in the frame
3. **Identify** — vision AI resolves the brand and corporate parent with a confidence score
4. **Investigate** — structured profile loads: environmental record, labor record, political donations, documented violations, proportionality context
5. **Act** — verified independent alternatives surface; share findings; file a civic witness report

## Screenshots

**1. Home — local feed with category filters and SNAP**

![Home screen showing local independents feed, category filters, and SNAP button](docs/screenshots/01-home-local-feed.jpeg)

The entry point. Local independent businesses near you, filterable by category. The SNAP button opens the camera. The INVESTIGATE bar accepts a brand name directly if you already know what you're looking at.

---

**2. Full investigation view — desktop (alternatives left, record right)**

![Desktop view showing alternatives panel on the left and investigation accordion on the right with Tax, Legal, Labor, Environmental, Political, Product Health, and Executives sections](docs/screenshots/02-tap-investigation-desktop.png)

The split layout shows the full product in one frame. Left: independent alternatives sourced from Etsy, Overpass, secondhand platforms, and repair resources. Right: the investigation accordion — Tax, Legal, Labor, Environmental, Political, Product Health, Executives — each expandable with sourced findings and evidence grades.

---

**3. Share the record — clean profile (Shambhala Publications)**

![Share the record screen showing Shambhala Publications clean record: 55-year independent press, no documented violations, family owned, 4 primary sources](docs/screenshots/03-share-record-clean.jpeg)

A clean record, publicly verified, with sources. This is what the investigation looks like when there is nothing to flag.

---

**4. City identity — local narrative layer (Indianapolis)**

![Local story screen for Indianapolis showing city narrative, location tags, and recreation landmarks](docs/screenshots/04-city-identity.jpeg)

The city identity layer surfaces a curated narrative about the local area — landmarks, culture, outdoor life, independent institutions. Not algorithmic. Not scraped. Written by the model from public record and edited for accuracy.

---

**5. Brand identified — inferred from scene**

![Investigation result showing brand detected as Apple macOS, high confidence, inferred from scene context](docs/screenshots/05-brand-identified.jpeg)

The vision step returns a confidence score and a method label. **High confidence** means the brand was read directly. **Inferred from scene** means it was resolved from object type, visual context, and surroundings. Both can be correct — only the label changes, and the label is always shown.

---

## Neutral by design — it is a mirror

The investigation finds what it finds.

A business with a clean record gets a clean record — publicly stated, sourced, and shown with the same UI rigor as a heavy file. A 55-year independent press with no documented violations, family owned, four primary sources: that is the finding. That is what gets published.

For honest independent businesses, that is not a liability. It is free verified advertising that no marketing budget can replicate. A public record saying your company has no documented labor findings, no environmental findings, no political entanglements — that is worth something. It is worth more than a review, because it comes from public record, not from a customer mood.

EthicalAlt is not an attack machine. It is a mirror. Corporations with bad records look bad in it. Businesses with clean records look clean in it. The mirror does not editorialize.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| API | Express (Node ≥ 20, ESM) |
| UI | React 19 + Vite 6 |
| AI — vision + investigation | Claude (primary) → Perplexity → Gemini (failover) |
| Database | PostgreSQL (optional — degrades gracefully without it) |
| Alternatives | Etsy API + Overpass (OpenStreetMap) |
| Local data | Native Land API, Eventbrite, Bandcamp |
| Monorepo | npm workspaces (`client/`, `server/`) |

---

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Node ≥ 20
- PostgreSQL (optional — most features work without it)
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com) (required for vision + investigation)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Swixixle/ETHICAL_ALTERNATIVES.git
cd ETHICAL_ALTERNATIVES
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

Open `server/.env` and set at minimum:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Everything else is optional. The app runs without a database — investigation profiles fall back to live AI generation, and civic features that require persistence are gracefully disabled.

### 3. Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Client: `http://localhost:5173`
- API: `http://localhost:3001`

### With database (full features)

```bash
createdb ethicalalt

# Add to server/.env:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/ethicalalt

# Initialize schema (adjust path if your process differs)
psql ethicalalt < server/db/schema.sql

# Optional: seed sample profiles
node server/db/import_profiles_v2.mjs
```

## How it works

### Investigation pipeline

```
Image + tap coordinates
        ↓
  vision.js — brand ID, confidence score, scene inventory
        ↓
  investigation.js — slug resolution
        ↓
  [DB profile exists?]
     YES → hydrate relational profile + optional JSON override
     NO  → live Claude research with web search tool loop
        ↓
  normalizeInvestigation() — canonical shape
        ↓
  finalizeInvestigation() — slug, press outlets, concern flags, timestamp
        ↓
  [violation metadata present?]
     YES → attachProportionality() — USSC reference + nearest BOP facility
        ↓
  Investigation payload → client
```

The AI provider layer handles failover transparently. If Claude is unavailable, Perplexity covers the text leg; Gemini covers vision fallback when keyed.

### Evidence and confidence

Per-section **evidence grades** and **profile type** (`database` vs realtime search) make uncertainty explicit. Treat live-generated text as a **starting point** — verify material claims against primary sources.

## Honest gaps

| Gap | Notes |
|-----|-------|
| No unified request tracing | `console` logging in investigation path only |
| No automated tests | Manual verification throughout |
| Camera API reliability | `getUserMedia` behavior varies on mobile — Safari is the worst offender |
| Mobile web, not native | UI is mobile-first but runs in a browser; no React Native or Capacitor yet |
| Profile corpus is static | Scale and search will eventually need an indexing strategy |
| No auth layer | Session-scoped only; civic features are rate-limited but unauthenticated |
| No docker-compose | Local setup requires manual Postgres provisioning |

---

## Risks

**AI investigation accuracy.** The live AI path uses Claude with web search. Claude can be wrong. Evidence grades and profile-type labeling are there so uncertainty is visible — treat `overall_concern_level` as a structured starting point for research, not a verdict.

**Legal exposure on corporate records.** Every factual claim needs a source. DB profiles are hand-curated with citations. Live-generated profiles should be verified against primary materials. This is the primary ongoing operational risk.

**Camera and tap on mobile web.** `getUserMedia` on Safari in PWA mode is fragile. Tap precision on small screens is a real UX problem. The architecture supports a native wrapper when the web version proves the product.

**No significant user load yet.** This is a serious prototype. It has not faced real adversarial use, scale, or edge cases.

---

## Roadmap

### Now
- Unified request ID tracing through the investigation pipeline
- Docker Compose for one-command local dev
- Basic E2E test coverage for the tap → investigate flow
- Mobile Safari camera reliability fixes

### Next
- Journalist and civic org outreach — direct contact, not PR
- Profile corpus expansion toward top 500 consumer brands
- PWA manifest + install prompt

### Later
- Native wrapper (Capacitor) when mobile web limits become the bottleneck
- Community profile contributions with moderation queue
- Expanded alternatives: co-ops, local business registry

## Contributing

Solo project in active development. Issues and PRs are welcome but reviewed slowly.

If you're a journalist, researcher, or investigator using this for real work — reach out directly. The share-to-regulator and witness registry features exist for you.

---

## Community board

The notice board lives at the **bottom of the main feed**. Same-day **offers** and **needs** (help / labor) with contact info; posts can be sorted by distance when the client sends coordinates. **No algorithmic ranking, no engagement mechanics.** It only lists posts — it does not match people, process payments, or verify identities. Neighbors coordinate on their own.
