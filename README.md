## What This Is

EthicalAlt is a visual ethical shopping lens. You photograph your surroundings — a party, a hotel lobby, a store, a street corner — tap any object in the photo, and receive two things:

**The record.** Everything documented in the public record about the company behind what you tapped. Tax strategies, court cases, corruption charges, labor violations, environmental enforcement actions, health implications, executive ownership web. Sourced to primary documents.

**The alternatives.** Real independent sellers matched to what you actually tapped. If it's a Levi's 501 in raw indigo, we find you the closest ethical equivalent at that specification level — not just "some jeans." Independent shops near you on a map. Global fair trade artisans. Worker-owned alternatives. Pre-populated secondhand searches.

No barcode required. No product in hand. Any photograph of anything.

## The Problem

Every tool that tried this before — Buycott (2012, peaked at 1M users, died 2016) — was limited to barcode scanning. You could not scan a storefront, clothing someone was wearing, a photo from last week, or anything handmade. The entire barcode-era ethical shopping space was frozen at the checkout counter.

Google Lens and Amazon Lens solved visual identification and immediately used it to route you back to Amazon and corporate commerce. The technology exists. The ethical application of it didn't.

EthicalAlt is the visual identification layer pointed in the opposite direction.

## How It Works

```
SNAP → TAP → KNOW → FIND
```

1. **SNAP** — photograph anything. No barcode. No specific framing. Any photo.

2. **TAP** — tap any object. The app attempts maximum-precision identification:
   not just "jeans" but "Levi's 501, straight fit, raw indigo." Not just "coffee"
   but "Starbucks Pike Place, paper cup with plastic lid."

3. **KNOW** — the investigation card fires:
   - Corporate parent chain (brand → parent → conglomerate)
   - Tax record (effective rate, offshore structures, government subsidies)
   - Legal record (court cases, settlements, criminal charges)
   - Labor record (OSHA violations, wage theft, union suppression)
   - Environmental record (EPA enforcement, penalties)
   - Political (lobbying spend, PAC donations, revolving door)
   - Product health (category-specific implications)
   - Executive ownership web (other businesses, documented concerns)

4. **FIND** — alternatives grid, ordered by proximity:
   - 📍 Near you (OSM Overpass + GPS, chain-filtered)
   - 🏙️ Nearest city ring (50mi radius from your nearest major city)
   - 📦 Ships to you (Etsy indie sellers, geocoded)
   - 🌍 Global artisans (NOVICA, WFTO verified, fair trade)
   - ♻️ Secondhand (pre-populated Depop, Vinted, Poshmark searches)
